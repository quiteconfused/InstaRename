InstaRename
***********

This project is a simple image renaming program. The image is cross referenced against google and if there is a best guess associated with the image it will rename it according to that if not it will leave it as it previously was.

This in turn lets the user quickly take images and have them automatically sorted according to content. 


This has been tested and works well on android jelly bean and ice cream sandwich :)
